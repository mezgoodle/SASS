# Sass

![CI](https://github.com/mezgoodle/SASS/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

[Sass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)) (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a style sheet language initially designed by [Hampton Catlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Catlin) and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum. After its initial versions, Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein have continued to extend Sass with SassScript, a scripting language used in Sass files.

## Motivation

One day I was taking [classes(Russian)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOlqVNC86XI&list=PL0lO_mIqDDFVv3vF9BG1j1RwfGcQEoxs2) on Sass and decided to do a repository on GitHub. This is not a project. It's a simple example of using this technology.

## Usage

1. Install Sass from [here](https://sass-lang.com/install). I was using an application [Prepros](https://prepros.io/), so you can too.

2. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mezgoodle/SASS.git
```

3. **Awesome!**. Use it as you want. :blush:
